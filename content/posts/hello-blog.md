# Welcome everyone

This would be the first post here, which will contain briefly answers for some thoughts. That I one might think about when checking a new blog.

## Why

I have been checking and reading blogs of others for a while now. And decides to give that a try and built my first own blog. In recent time I got myself into productivity life cycle, and this blog is going to take part of that routine

## What

I have intention to write in subjects; That either relates to my plans, about technologies that I interested for or just about interesting random stuff or whatever.

## How

Despite that, I have no experience in general writing nor technical writing; I think that I could make it work through long term tries. And thinking that no one going to read this blog anyway :)
